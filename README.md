- 👋 Hi, I’m @SkyDiverStar
- 👀 I’m interested in self improving and learing to become a version of myself I am proud of.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and git (again), with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python in the queue.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project concerning games, enviroment or other things, just hit me up and I will most definitly look into it, when I see it.
- 📫 How to reach me: dunno, that is a little to private to talk here about. Even on a work bases.
